/*
 * The key for this program was to figure out how to get it to work with
 * the switch statement.  I did this by using a flag with an 'if'
 * statement that would scan a character into the controling variable,
 * 'calc', for the switch statement.
 *
 * The equals operators, '==', in the if statements indicate that I can
 * possibly use a switch statement because I am looking for a single
 * value, not a range of values.  In this case it is a flag of 1 or 0 and
 * it comes up for the missing variable.
 *
 *  printf("Thickness of conductor (m) \n>> ");
 *  flag = scanf("%lf", thickness);
 *  if (flag == 0)
 *  {
 *     scanf(" %c", &question_mark);
 *     calc = 'x';
 *  }
 *
 * The scanf in the 'if' statement clears out the question mark character,
 * otherwise the compiler would fall through the code, looking for a place
 * to scan that character.
 *
 * Finally, I assign a letter for that variable into 'calc' and send
 * it back as a return value from the function.  So, I got all of the
 * variables I needed and sent them back with pointers, and I got the
 * controlling variable value I needed and sent it back with the return
 * statement.
 *
 * In terms of pointers, I get six variables in the main function with
 * pointers in the 'get_information' function.  I also get the calc
 * variable with this function.  Once I do that, I just send the variables
 * down to the 'get_calc' and 'display' functions.  Because the displays
 * are output in those functions, the variables to not need to point
 * anywhere else, so I don't need any more pointers after the first
 * function.
 *
 * At the end, I see how I might put function calls for each calculation
 * within the cases of the 'switch' statement, but it seems like that
 * would add a lot of code without making things clearer or easier in any
 * way because I don't see how I would need those individual calculations
 * outside of the switch statement or program I am running.  The switch
 * statement could be the modular element that I could take with me.
