This is a repository of homework problems I solved from Problem Solving and Program Design in C by Hanly and Koffman.  Its purpose is to show potential employers that I can write clear code with helpful documentation.  And, programers that are learning c might also be interested in the programs because they offer many trace statements and notes about they work.
